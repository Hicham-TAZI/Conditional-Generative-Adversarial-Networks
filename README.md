# Conditional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
This is a project of Generative adversarial networks

For this project we will work with MNIST data, which are available in Keras. In a first part we will build a GAN through the variables of the images. Then in a second part we will build a CGAN by labeling the outputs and introducing a Bayesian approach.
